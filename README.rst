**Friture** is an application to visualize and analyze live audio data in real-time.

Friture displays audio data in several widgets, such as a scope, a spectrum analyzer, or a rolling 2D spectrogram.

This program can be useful to analyze and equalize the audio response of a hall, or for educational purposes, etc.

The name *Friture* is a french word for *frying*, also used for *noise* in a sound.

See the `project homepage`_ for screenshots and more information.

A note for this fork:

In this fork, you can display the FFT spectrum seperately by choosing the right channel in the dock setting. 
I also add a dock called "FFT Scope IAH", where you can choose to plot the FFT amplitude at specific frequency at each channel. "IAH" represents International Audio HOlding, which is the company I am working in.
